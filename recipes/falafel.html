<p class="caption-one"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel">Falafel</a> is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter made from ground chickpeas, 
    broad beans, or both. Falafel is a traditional 
    Middle Eastern food, commonly served in a pita, 
    which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread 
    known as taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers 
    to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. 
    The falafel balls are topped with salads, 
    pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with t
    ahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone 
    as a snack or served as part of a meze tray 
    (assortment of appetizers).</p>

    <h1 class="sub-one">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>1/2 medium-sized onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>3 springs of fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red hot pepper flakes or 1 whole hot chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
<h1 class="sub-two">Directions</h1>
<ol class="ol">
    <li>Pick out foreign matter from the peas before placing them in a large bowl, cover generously with water and soak uncovered, at room temperature overnight, adding more water if necessary.</li>
    <li>Drain peas, and place them along with the other ingredients and 2 tablespoons water in a food processor. Pulse until the peas are finely ground, about the size of couscous. Roll about 1 tablespoon of the batter into a ball between your palms.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot to 350Â°F. Carefully deep fry each ball until golden brown, about 5 minutes each. They will fall to the bottom and rise during the frying. Serve hot stuffed in a pita or by themselves, covered in tahini sauce.</li>
</ol>
