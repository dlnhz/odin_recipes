Odin recipe project
This is my first project with the Odin Project. The first part of this project
is to build a simple recipe website in HTML. In doing this have demostrated by 
basic knowledge of HTML and how to put together a website, and how to use github. 


I added some basic CSS to make the webpages look more interesting. you can view my project here: https://dlnhz.github.io/odin_recipes/
